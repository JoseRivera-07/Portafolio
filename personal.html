            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Jose Miguel Rivera, and I’m a responsible, supportive, and sociable person who enjoys learning, creating, and connecting with others. Outside of programming, I love reading, going to the gym, and watching sci-fi movies or English-language series. I deeply value friendship, responsibility, punctuality, and clear communication.</p>

            <p> I have experience with Python, HTML, CSS, and basic CRUD concepts in SQL. Currently, I’m working on a mental-health project focused on educational and workplace environments — a forum-style platform designed to provide a space for expression and support. While backend development is what interests me the most, I’m currently focused on frontend as I progress through the HTML and CSS module at Riwi.</p>

            <p>What motivates me is seeing my ideas come to life — creating something that works, looks good, and could one day make a positive impact on humanity. I enjoy facing challenges, finding new approaches to problem-solving, and building things that didn’t exist before.</p>

            <p>Right now, I am training at Riwi, a software development company, where I'm learning the foundations of web development. My short-term goal is to strengthen my technical English so I can enter Blackbird after presenting my integrator project. In the long term, I aim to become highly qualified and offer my skills to major companies.</p>

            <p>Although I’d like to work as a freelancer someday, my biggest goal is to join a large company that not only supports my ideas but also helps me grow them into real projects — ideally in a collaborative type of partnership.</p>

            <p>A bit more about me: I love rainy weather (even though I hate feeling cold), I enjoy teamwork, and I promote clean, organized code. Above all, my greatest inspiration is my little sister Susana, my family, and the desire to become better day after day.</p>
